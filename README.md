## 💡 Technical Highlights
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and separation of concerns (Model-View-Controller).

* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Implements **Recursive Backtracking (DFS)** to validate word paths on the grid efficiently in real-time.
* **Architecture (MVC):**
    * **Model:** Manages game logic, board generation, and dictionary validation.
    * **View:** Handles UI components and user interactions (buttons, timer, score).
    * **Controller:** Bridges the gap, handling events and updating the state.
* **Event-Driven UI:** Responsive graphical interface built with Python's standard libraries.

## 🚀 Features
* 🧩 **Randomized Board Generation:** Ensures a valid distribution of letters based on standard Boggle dice.
* ⚡ **Real-time Validation:** Instant feedback on word validity and path continuity.
* ⏱️ **Countdown Timer:** Manages game sessions with automatic termination.
* 🏆 **Dynamic Scoring:** Calculates scores based on word length complexities.
